# 💻 My NixOS Configuration Setup

Welcome to my NixOS configuration repository! This setup is based on the fantastic Misterio77/nix-starter-configs template, designed to help users get started with NixOS configuration in a simple and structured way.
## 📚 Overview

This repository contains my personal configurations for NixOS, organized and managed using the Nix package manager. It's structured in a modular way, making it easy to customize, manage, and extend my system.
## 🌟 Features

- **Declarative System Configuration**: Manage every aspect of the system, from packages to services, all from a single configuration file.
- **Modular Setup**: Organized and split into multiple modules for better maintainability.
- **Multi-User Support**: Configurations for both system-wide settings and individual user profiles.
- **Flakes**: Powered by Nix Flakes for reproducible builds and easier management of dependencies.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The following structure represents my NixOS configuration files, organized into relevant directories for modularity and maintainability:

├── home-manager # Home-manager configurations for user environments 
├── modules # Custom NixOS modules 
├── nixos # System-wide NixOS configurations 
├── overlays # Overlays for customizing package sets 
├── pkgs # Custom packages and Nix expressions 
├── flake.lock # Lock file for Nix Flakes (ensures reproducibility) 
├── flake.nix # Nix Flakes configuration 
└── shell.nix # Development shell setup


### Key Files and Directories

- **`home-manager/`**: Configures home environments and packages for each user.
- **`modules/`**: Custom NixOS modules for specific configurations or services.
- **`nixos/`**: Main NixOS configuration directory (e.g., system-wide settings, hardware configurations).
- **`overlays/`**: Nix overlays for extending and customizing package sets.
- **`pkgs/`**: Custom Nix packages and expressions tailored for specific needs.
- **`flake.lock`**: Lock file generated by Nix Flakes to ensure reproducible builds.
- **`flake.nix`**: Defines the inputs, outputs, and system configurations using Nix Flakes.
- **`shell.nix`**: Configuration for setting up the development environment shell.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use this setup, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rshohruh/nixos-config.git
   cd nixos-config
   ```

2. **Install NixOS: Follow the official NixOS installation guide**.

3. **Set Up the System:**

    Link or copy the configuration files to your NixOS installation.
    Run the following to apply the configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
    ```
4. Manage Home Configurations:

    Ensure you have home-manager installed.
    Apply home-manager configurations:

    ```bash
    home-manager switch --flake .
    ```

## ⚙️ Customization

This setup is designed to be modular and easy to extend. Here are a few customization options:

- **System Packages**: Add or remove system-wide packages by editing the `nixos/configuration.nix` file or creating additional modules in `nixos/modules`.
- **User Packages**: Customize user environments by editing the `home/` directory with user-specific packages and configurations.
- **Services**: Enable or disable system services (e.g., SSH, Docker, etc.) in the `nixos/modules` directory.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- **NixOS**: The Linux distribution with a declarative configuration.
- **Nix**: The package manager used by NixOS.
- **Nix Flakes**: Optional but highly recommended for better dependency management.
- **Home-Manager**: For managing user profiles, including packages, dotfiles, and configurations.
